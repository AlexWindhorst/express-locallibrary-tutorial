# Express-Locallibrary-Tutorial
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Express_Nodejs

## Learning Objectives</br>
The goal of this project was to create a working library site by learning and using node, express, and mongoDB.</br>

## Challenges</br>
Following the tutorial when creating this project was quite dissorientating at first. There were many new concepts and programs that were introduced right from the beggining, making the project intimidating. After re-reading the tutorial parts and looking furthing into Express, I was able to understand the main concepts quite a bit better. I believe that investing time to learn how to use Express even further will be of benefit in the future, due to the many middleware packages that have already been developed and tested by others. Continueing to use Express should allow me to bypass many of the web developement problems I may face in the future.
